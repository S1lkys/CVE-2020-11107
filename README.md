# CVE-2020-11107
This is a writeup for CVE-2020-11107 I've found.


An issue was discovered in XAMPP before 7.2.29, 7.3.x before 7.3.16 , and 7.4.x before 7.4.4 on Windows.
An unprivileged user can change a .exe configuration in xampp-contol.ini for all users (including admins) to enable arbitrary command execution.

All this can be done through xampps control-panel.


XAMPP allows an unprivileged User to access and modify its editor and browser configuration. The default value is notepad.exe
The default value can be changed to set a bat file as the editor or browser. After saving the configuration, it changed for every user which can access the control panel. 
If an attacker sets the notepad value to a malicious .exe file or .bat file it gets executed after another user tries to open the log files via the control panel. This can result in grating a normal user admin privileges or worse.


A step by step PoC can be found below:
1. Default values of XAMPPâ€˜s config file.
